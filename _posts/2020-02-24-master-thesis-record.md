### 2020.02.21
1. Decided to one interesting master thesis about robotics at my univeristy
2. Make plans about how to find a master thesis topic

Excited for the idea to work independently on a really interesting topic instead of a easy-to-pass one

### 2020.02.22--2020.02.24
1. Checked the course "Introduction to mobile robotics" 
2. Went over the following topics:
  - Robot motion model
  - Robot sensor model
  - Bayes Filter
  - Localization
  - Mapping 
  - SLAM

### 2020.02.25
1. Checked the potential supervisors and their latest reseach paper 
Found several Phds that I am interested in. There is one I especially like.
