## Probabilistic robotics
Probabilistic robotics develops probabilistic algorithms to deal with uncertainty in robotics.

Probabilistic robotics falls in between model-based and behavior-based techniques.

||Probabilistic algorithms|Deterministic algorithms|
|-------|--------|--------|
|Robustness in face of uncertainty| High| Low|
|Computation effieciecy| Low|High|
|Intractability| High, often an approximation is needed||
